# Introduction to python

This introduction to python builds heavily on the materials developed and maintained by graduate students in the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder (https://github.com/ATOC-REU/python_bootcamp). I adapted the scripts for more oceanographic use cases, which are more relevant when you do a project with me. These scripts are meant to be run on the SURF Research Cloud. 

The scripts are work in progress and will diverge more from the original files over time, but all credit goes to the graduate students at CU Boulder.
